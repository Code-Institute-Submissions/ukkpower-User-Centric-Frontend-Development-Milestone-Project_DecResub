This is the main website for the company Hotelier Academy. The purpose of this website is to market the business by explaining what the Hotelier Academy training platform is, the features and the benefits to the hotel industry.  The target audience is b2b users.

The design is a desktop first approach as that is the main device the target audience is using. However the website is fully responsive at its core and will be able to deliver its goals through any device.

The central design philosophy for the website is a text driven design with some complimentary images. The text is specifically laid out to be very easy to read and deliver its message quickly to the user. By using a text design the website by it nature will be fast loading.
